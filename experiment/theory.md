### Theory
Colours can speak in ways that are every bit as powerful as language. They can reflect the personality of your brand. <br>
They can attract users, and they can better communicate your message by distinguishing the variety of information/data and action. <br>
Colour can set the basic mood, tone, concept, and connotation for a brand or product.<br>
Unfortunately Colour (colour) blindness (colour vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women (0.5%) in the world. <br>
This figure is very similar in India (8% Men and 0.4% Women). <br>
Worldwide, there are approximately 300 million people with colour-blindness.<br>
Normal colour vision uses all three types of light cones correctly and is known as trichromacy. <br>
There are three different types of effect produced depending upon which cone type is faulty including “Protanomaly (Protanopia)”, which is reduced sensitivity to red light; “Deuteranomaly (Deuteranopes)”, which is reduced sensitivity to green light (most common form of colour blindness) and “Tritanomaly (Tritanopes)” which is a reduced sensitivity to blue light and is extremely rare.
